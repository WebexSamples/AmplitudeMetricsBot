# metricsBot
A POC for metrics bot on Webex

To run the Bot, 
1. Clone the repo
2. Run the command - 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt'
3. Go to https://pypi.org/project/python-webex-bot/ 
4. Follow the setup steps provided
5. Run main.py
6. In a separate terminal/command prompt, run PlotQueue.py

Note: There is a .secrets folder containing the details for API authentication and other confidential details, so you would have to either create a new bot and get details, or request one of the owners/collaborators of the repo for the folder, which they could send to you only after confirmation of access
